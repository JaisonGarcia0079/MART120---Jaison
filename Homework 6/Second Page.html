  <h1> Mobile Suit Gundam - Short Story </h1>


<p>One of my favorite stories is from a show called MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM. It's about a futuristic society who has moved into the far reaches of space
and has engaged in their first war known as the One Year War. It sees the young Amuro Ray reluctantly fight a war against the Principality of Zeon
in a powerful mobile suit known as the Gundam. Through traveling from space to Earth, Amuro along with his found family aboard the ship he now calls
home, beats the evil Principality of Zeon while realizing the true value of those he fights with. </p>
